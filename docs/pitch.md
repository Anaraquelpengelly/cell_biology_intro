### Prokaryotic cells
* Simpler organisms
* Mostly live as independent individuals or communities (they are mostly unicellular)
* Don't store their DNA in a distinct membrane-enclosed nucleus
* Examples are bacteria (such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*)  and archea

### Eukaryotic cells
* in general are bigger and more elaborate than prokaryotic cells
* generally form multicellular organisms
* complex cellular structure (e.g. store their DNA in a distinct membrane enclosed nucleus)
* contain many organelles (like mithochondria, chloroplasts in plants)
