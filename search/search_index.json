The Cell Eukaryotic cells within a fatty tissue in Drosophila melanogaster . Prokaryotic cells Simpler organisms. Mostly live as independent individuals or communities (they are mostly unicellular). Don't store their DNA in a distinct membrane-enclosed nucleus. Generally have circular DNA. Examples are bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae ) and archaea. Eukaryotic cells In general are bigger and more elaborate than prokaryotic cells. Generally form multicellular organisms. Complex cellular structure (e.g. store their DNA in a distinct membrane enclosed nucleus). Contain many organelles (like mitochondria, chloroplasts in plants). All Cells Store Their Hereditary information in the same linear Chemical Code: DNA Nucleotides: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). DNA base complementarity Hydrogen bonds form between A & T (2 bonds) and between C & G (3 bonds). Cells copy their DNA via replication. Concept Detailed representation * High fidelity duplication mechanism (1 error per 10 10 nucleotides). * Each strand of DNA acts as a template for its own duplication. * Conducted by DNA-polymerase in a 5' to 3' direction. Questions for you: Do you know the length of the DNA in the nucleus of a human cell? Answer: Do you know the length of the DNA in the nucleus of a human cell? 2 m Questions for you: Do you know the approximate diameter of the nucleus of an average human cell? Answer Do you know the approximate diameter of the nucleus of an average human cell? 6 \u00b5m How is this achieved? How is this achieved? DNA packaging DNA is packaged into chromosomes Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes 22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes Different eukaryotic organisms have different numbers of chromosomes. Nucleosomes are the structural building blocks of Chromatin nucleosomes contain two copies of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3 & H4 around which are wrapped ~ 147 base pairs of DNA. H1, the linker histone acts as a spacer between nucleosomes. histones can be modified on their protruding tails. These modifications can result in the regulation of transcription of the genes that carry them. Transcription Transcription Takes place in the nucleus Catalysed by RNA polymerase II (for most genes) transcription of DNA to RNA. Difference between RNA and DNA DNA RNA 2'deoxyribose ribose T U The structure of eukaryotic genes Promoter (TATA box) Transcription start site (TSS) Transcriptional stop (mRNA PolyA site and mRNA cleavage site Can have exons and introns. 1. Initiation of transcription General transcription factors (GTFs) bind to the TATA box on the promoter, pull apart the two strands of DNA and recruit RNA polymerase II and activate it by chemically modifying (by phosphorylation) it so it initiates transcription. 2. Transcriptional Elongation The speed of transcription by RNA polymerase II is different across different genes. Elongation factors, (which are proteins) associate with RNA polymerase and help it transcribe through a variety of genes. 3. Termination of Transcription When the RNA polymerase passes the 'cleavage and poly-Adenylation (poly-A)' site, the cleavage factors which travel with the enzyme cleave the RNA from the polymerase. Next, the poly-A polymerase (PAP) adds A nucleotides to the 3'end produced by the cleavage. 3. Termination of Transcription The mature mRNA molecule is now ready to be exported to the cytoplasm to be translated. Translation Translation Not all transcripts are translated Takes place in the cytoplasm 'translates' mature mRNAs into proteins Catalysed by ribosomes Facilitated by transfer RNAs (tRNAs) The Genetic Code Transfer RNAs (t-RNAs) Initiation of Translation Termination of Translation At the end of translation, polypeptide chains, can be chemically modified to take their 3D conformation. Proteins are the building blocks of the cell Functions of Proteins Enzymes (e.g. convert precursor molecules to metabolites) Structural components of the cell Messenger functions Signal transduction Molecular machines Antibodies Toxins Hormones All proteins bind other molecules. Spotlight: How many genes do humans have? Salzberg, S.L., BMC Biol 16, 94 (2018). Types of RNA Spotlight: mRNA vaccines In multicellular organisms different cell types have different functions and structures. However, they (in the vast majority of cases), have the same DNA sequence. So how is this achieved? Regulation of transcription in Eukaryotes External signals. Binding sites for DNA-binding proteins within a gene (repression or activation of transcription). Chemical modifications of histones, can make the DNA more or less accessible. Chemical modifications of DNA and RNA, like methylation. Some of these modifications can be inherited to the next generation of cells after cell division.
